1. Name assignment(variables and constants)
By using the assignment = operator: <name> = <value>, a variable can be reassigned (or re-bound) to different values (different object types) over its lifetime.

>>> my_first_variable = 1  # my_first_variable bound to an integer object of value one.
>>> my_first_variable = 2  # my_first_variable re-assigned to integer value 2.

>>> print(type(my_first_variable))
<class 'int'>

>>> print(my_first_variable)
2

>>> my_first_variable = "Now, I'm a string." # You may re-bind a name to a different object type and value.
>>> print(type(my_first_variable))
<class 'str'>

>>> print(my_first_variable)
"Now, I'm a string."  # Strings can be declared using single or double quote marks.
